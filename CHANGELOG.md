## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- `POST /v1/auth/bootstrap` — unauthenticated token bootstrap endpoint that exchanges `AUTH_SECRET` (passed in `X-Auth-Secret`) for a signed JWT, breaking the chicken-and-egg dependency on `POST /v1/admin/tokens` for external clients (issue #27). Uses constant-time secret comparison, hard-fails when `AUTH_SECRET` is unset, validates tenants against the configured set, and emits `auth_bootstrap_issued` / `auth_bootstrap_denied` audit events.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- Updated OpenAPI spec to document new `debug` request parameter and `exitSignal`, `timedOut`, `durationMs` response fields on exec-sync 200/408 responses.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Enriched exec-sync response with `exitSignal`, `timedOut`, and `durationMs` fields for better error disambiguation.
- Enriched 408 timeout response with `timedOut` and `durationMs` fields.
- `debug` request flag on exec-sync, exec (SSE), and MCP `bash_exec` that prepends `set -x` for command-level tracing without modifying the submitted script.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- Migrated Claude Code skills from `commands/virtualfs-api.md` + `skills/virtualfs-api/` into the plugin layout under `.claude-plugin/` and `plugins/virtualfs/`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Initial release of `virtualfs-api`: persistent filesystem backend + HTTP/MCP API for `just-bash` sandboxes.
- SQL-backed `IFileSystem` implementation (`SqlFs`) with Postgres, MySQL, and Azure SQL dialects.
- Adjacency-list directory model with content-addressable blob storage and global dedup.
- Path cache (eager) and content cache (lazy LRU, 50 MB/session) for low-latency reads.
- HTTP API (Hono): sandboxes CRUD, file operations, exec (sync + SSE), ingest/export, admin GC.
- MCP server with 10 tools over streamable HTTP transport.
- Bearer-token auth, RLS-based sandbox isolation, default-deny symlinks, error sanitization.
- Multi-tenant routing and session rehydration.
- Docker image and Azure Container Apps deployment config.
